- Extract and reuse the environment configuration commercially
- Include environment files in derivative works without permission

### Environment Component Attribution

When using the development environment:
- The environment is provided as-is for enhanced development experience
- Pre-installed tools are available for your use
- Environment configuration remains proprietary Vyges components
- Your development content remains your own and can be licensed as you choose

## Proprietary Components and Usage Rights

- You're not required to license the environment structure itself

### For Commercial Use
- Your development content can be used commercially under Apache-2.0
- You can sell products incorporating your development work
- You can license your development tools to others
- You must include the Apache-2.0 license text and attribution

## Attribution Requirements

When using Apache-2.0 licensed content, you must:

1. **Include the License**: Copy the Apache-2.0 license text
2. **State Changes**: Note any modifications you made
3. **Preserve Notices**: Keep copyright and license notices

## Questions and Clarifications

If you have questions about licensing scope:

1. **Development Content**: Generally covered by Apache-2.0
2. **Environment Structure**: Generally not covered by Apache-2.0
3. **Build Processes**: Generally not covered by Apache-2.0
4. **Tool Integration**: Generally not covered by Apache-2.0

When in doubt, focus on whether the content is your **development work** (licensed) versus the **environment framework** (not licensed).
